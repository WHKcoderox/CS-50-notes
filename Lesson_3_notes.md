# Video Lesson 3 Notes

### Computational Limits
- The most important part about adjusting to a computational thinking standpoint is to acknowledge how tedious certain seemingly easy processes are because of how we may take our intuitions for granted.

### Big O, Omega and Theta Notations - The Different Program Runtimes
- Big O is the maximum runtime and Omega is the minimum runtime, and if the Big O runtime is the same as the Omega runtime, it can be denoted by theta.
