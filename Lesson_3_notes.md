# Video Lesson 3 Notes

### Computational Limits
- The most important part about adjusting to a computational thinking standpoint is to acknowledge how tedious certain seemingly easy processes are because of how we may take our intuitions for granted.

### Big O, Omega and Theta Notations - The Different Program Runtimes
- Big O is the maximum runtime and Omega is the minimum runtime, and if the Big O runtime is the same as the Omega runtime, it can be denoted by theta.
- In Big O, you generally take the term with the highest costs and use that to label the program runtime. These are quite estimated, so don't fret the details like constant multipliers. One notable exception is if your program (hopefully not) has miraculously touched the heavens with an exponential runtime (of some **O(c<sup>n</sup>)**), in which case please don't change c.
- Sorting algorithms will always have a runtime of > O(n). This is because it is theoretically unsound to claim that a sort can be blind about certain elements and yet still produce a correct final result 100% of the time.
